# Lunabotics
Repository for all images and code files for the variety of Written Projects required for NASA Lunabotics 2023

This will be the primary location for storing code files. Discord can continue to be a location for sharing files, but GitHub will become the location for storing iterations and archiving those same files for future reference. This is in hopes that the future classes will contiune this mission to compete and complete interesting mechanical and programming challenges.
